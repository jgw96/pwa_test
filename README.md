# PWAPrimer Basic

Welcome to the basic version of the PWAPrimer!

This project gives you a basic starter with everything you need to build a basic Progressive Web App. This project does not require anything be installed, but if [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed you can access extra functionality such as a simple development server and the ability to test your PWA by using [webhint.io](https://webhint.io/)

## Getting Started

If you have Node installed all you need to do to get started is run `npm run dev`. This will start a simple server that will allow you to see your Progressive Web App by opening `http://localhost:3333` in your browser.

## Webhint
To test your PWA and make sure it follows all best practices, you can run `npm run webhint`. This will start a production web server, test your PWA and then give you guidance on how to make your PWA better.
